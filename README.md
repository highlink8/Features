Highlink is a decentralised synthetic asset contract protocol built on Tron. The contract is devised in such a way that everything is controlled by the contract itself autonomously. It follows a specific protocol and returns output based on the same. There are functions that are defined for the user and these functions control the major part of the contract. Functions like buy, sell, withdraw etc can directly be accessed by the user and anyone can call the totalTron function to check the liquidity of the exchange. This creates a direct entry point for the user and it is very helpful in creating an environment that has no one to control or no owner to change things as they are.
